<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- What I'm writing in now is a comment. "Doctype Html" basically tells the browser that it is a HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) document -->
<html> <!-- This is the root to a HTML file -->
<head> <!-- This displays all the content that isn't displayed on the webpage. For example the title... at the top of the page where the tab name is. This one is currently called "New File"-->
  <title>Welcome to my First Webpage</title> <!-- You can name it anything -->
  </head> <!-- You may have noticed already that tags with the "/" are closing tags. But not all tags are closing tags. -->
  
  <body> <!-- This tag "body" will display everything on the webpage -->
    <h1>I am the biggest header!</h1> <!-- This is a header, the biggest of them all. There are 6 headings - 1 is the biggest to 6 being the smallest. It is bold text -->
    <p>I am small writing!</p> <!-- This is the "paragraph" tag where you can write normal text -->
  </body>
</html> <!-- Okay, we have made our little website, now for trying it! Remember you can change the text of the paragraph, heading and title tags. And another question you may have is why there are spaces between tags on the left side, this is called indentation and adds structure to the code.
